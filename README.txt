Front-End Code Test

The task is to convert Design Mockups into Responsive HTML. 
Our recommendation is to not spend too much time trying to get it perfect, but demonstrate your skills through well-planned code structure and industry standard 
conventions. This means code setup and organisation, as well as formatting, comments and readable variable names. 
This will be our primary assessment focus. 


Included is 2 PSDs (desktop and mobile versions) and images.

The main elements of this task are:
• Mobile-first Responsive
• Build with client-side Javascript 
(MV* framework eg Angular, React, Ractive)



Requirements:


• Use of CSS Preprocessor (Less or Sass)

• Browser testing - IE9+ and modern browsers

• Scalable content (ie – adding extra data does not break design)



Optional:


• Content rendered from JSON


Please include any workflow files in your final submission.

I am available for any questions you may have, and would encourage you to send through whatever you can do,
as getting it right in the browser is not the only thing we will be looking at.
